VEBS is a ML/AI based system based on the concept of computer bootstraping, aiming to reduce the fatality rate due to road accidents.

IMPACT ANALYSIS OF THE PROBLEM:
India is still a developing country, but it is working phenomenally towards establishing itself as a global leader in industrialization and technical development. Due to this, our country is achieving milestones and topping the charts in various fields, but one aspect in which our country shouldn’t achieve top rank is “Increasing number of road accidents”. It’s really heartbreaking to know that India has been on the top of list of countries with highest number of road fatalities since 2009, according to the first Global Status Report published by WHO. The cause of these accidents can be human errors, but studies show that vehicle defaults are a major reason of proliferating road accidents. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), tire problems account for 35% of accidents where vehicle failure is the main cause of crash, brake issues comprise 22% of accidents. Similarly, Steering and suspension malfunctions lead to loss of control of the car, and headlights and brake failures often come into play in low visibility situations leading to accidents. I have conducted surveys to analyse the need of vehicle fitness and for more than 65% people vehicle plays a crucial role in ensuring safety of a driver.
India is emerging phenomenally towards establishing itself as a global leader in industrialization and technical development.

The solution to the problem:
Topic: VEBS: Vehicle-Fitness Ensuring BIOS Setup 
This system will use the technology similar to what a computer uses. When a computer is turned on, POST (Power-On-Self-Test) starts which is the diagnostic testing sequence that the computer’s BIOS run to determine whether all the devices are working properly or not. The POST, working on the same conditions will be installed in the vehicles. 
This system will operate certain devices, which in turn, will check the vehicle’s compatibility and will display all the defects on the screen, installed in front of the drivers itself. The main processing unit will operate the POST immediately within about 3-5 seconds after the vehicle is turned on and will display the results on the installed LED screen. 
The following devices connected to our MPU (main processing unit) will detect the defects:-
FOR ASSURING SEAT BELT USE- A pulse sensor on seat belt will sense the pulses/ hear beat of the driver, it will radiate electric signals which will be received by the receiver. The car will start, if and only if, the receiver has received the signals ensuring the that driver has worn the seatbelt.
FOR HEADLIGHTS- Light Sensors will be installed inside the glass of headlights so that whenever it detects light, it is off and whenever there is no light, it turns on. So whenever sensor is turned on, it will send electric signal to the screen that the headlights are not working.
FOR BLOWN OUT TIRES- We will implant the SIT (Self inflating tire technology) in the vehicle which uses the energy of the wheel to self-inflate the tires as needed. 
FOR BRAKES- The brake warning light will be turned on if there is any fault in the brakes, then it will display about the brake on the screen which is at fault.
FOR STEERING AND SUSPENSION- Whenever steering and suspension lacks oil, the APS (automatic lubrication system) will lubricate it to avoid any stuck in these parts while driving. Whenever the oil will be below some pre- recognized level, the touch sensor will send information to the screen to have it filled again.
This self-start to analyse the health conditions of the vehicle is the strength of this VEBS system. Highlighting the increased number of accidents caused due to sudden shortcomings in vehicles or the pre-planned murder by failing the brakes, mark the importance and longing for this idea as soon as possible.
